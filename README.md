🖥️ I am a computer science student based in Arizona, currently studying at Northern Arizona University. Passionate about coding and technology, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, complemented by minors in Informatics and Cyber Security.

🌟 With a keen interest in programming languages, I enjoy diving into Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js — constantly expanding my skills and knowledge. Whether it's crafting elegant Python scripts, building dynamic web applications with JavaScript, or automating workflows, I'm always excited to tackle new challenges and explore innovative solutions.

🚀 Beyond the classroom, I actively seek opportunities to engage with fellow programmers — sharing insights, collaborating on projects, and contributing to the vibrant developer community. Whether it’s exchanging ideas on GitHub, participating in coding clubs, or attending tech meetups, I thrive on connecting with like-minded individuals.

🔒 As a believer in the importance of cybersecurity, I'm deepening my understanding of this critical field through my Cyber Security minor. Committed to staying updated on the latest security trends and best practices, I strive to contribute to a safer digital world.

📚 Let's connect and embark on this coding journey together! Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities, coding discussions, or even just to share your favorite programming memes. Happy coding!
